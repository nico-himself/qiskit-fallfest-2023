The question we're asking is \"which door would the other Guardian tell me **not** to open?\" This question is phrased this way very deliberately. It ensures that no matter which Guardian we ask, the truth-teller or the liar, they both will give the same answer, the *correct* answer. \n",

In order to accomplish this, we need to introduce a new gate, **the swap gate.** This one is very straightforward, The SWAP gate swaps the states of two qubits. We apply is by simply calling the method `.swap(qubit1, qubit2)` on our quantum circuit.\n",

    "#### Qiskit Runtime Primitives: Introducing Sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give a more scientifically accurate explanation for why we run our circuits thousands of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the main point of interest here, the core capability of quantum computers that sets them apart from classical computers is their ability to generate non-classical probability distributions as their outputs. The inherent nature of the highly probabilistic results we get require us to have multiple runs (shots) for the same circuit to generate usable information. That usable information is typically seen in the form of probability distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the output we get is a probability distribution, one typical thing we might want to do is to sample from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the main thing we do here is **sample probability distributions.** This brings us to something new: **The Sampler**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sampler is one of the first Qiskit Runtime **Primitives**. Primitives are core functions that make it easier to build modular algorithms and applications. In the future, we think the vast majority of people using quantum computers will do so using Qiskit Runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sampler essentially does what it says in its name. By sampling from its output, it estimates the entire quasi-probability distribution of a given quantum circuit. This is a program that takes a user's circuit as an input and generates an error-mitigated readout of quasiprobabilities. This provides users a way to better evaluate shot results using error mitigation and enables them to more efficiently evaluate the possibility of multiple relevant data points in the context of destructive interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to the familiar output of \"counts\" you usually get when you run a circuit. Here, however, you obtain a quasi-probability distribution output as a result of the error mitigation routine involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, you have access to a greater range of information data points that you can use however you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "The information obtained from a quasi-probability distribution representation may be of more relevance for investigating likelihoods of true probability distributions and computing unbiased expectation value points in exchange for a sampling overhead. These distributions, broadly speaking, can behave similar to true probability theory in some sense with the difference being that they have a few constraints of the original theory relaxed, one of which is the possiblity of having negative data points representing \"negative\" probability (but collectively still summing up to 1). These, which should not be mistaken for true probabilities, can be estimated to a nearest true probability distribution up to certain error boundary based on the context of usage. Few example use cases where Sampler could be of interest are: Grovers search, QSVM routines, Stabilizer computation, Optimization routines etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's re-run the last exercise by using Sampler by using a same quantum circuit."
